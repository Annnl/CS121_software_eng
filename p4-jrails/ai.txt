AI Use Experience:
I used AI to teach me some functions and SQL that I don't know
I used AI to examine my code for any suggestions
I used AI to debug error by autograder.

Advantages:
1. It helps me write SQL in java.

2. Find the program of multiple instance of connections.

Disadvantages:
1. AI suggests to use private Factory method to create the instance of HTML
    internally by View methods, but the provided test cases need an access to
    the constructor.
