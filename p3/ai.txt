Using AI experience in part 2:
Advantages:
    AI helped me understand how to extract multiple sub-annotations with
    combination parameter types.

    AI warpped part of my code by helper functions to reduce code reuse and 
    make it more structured.

    AI helped me look for what is missing, like lack of robustness.


Disadvantages:
    AI suggested to replace getConstructor() by getDeclaredConstructor(),
    and replace getMethods() by getDeclaredMethods(), but it makes no difference
    on this project, since the project assumes all methods are public.

    AI usually used more relevant SubClass of uncatched exception, with output
    message to demonstrate how the exception happens, but it is not required by
    autograder of this project.
