1. I am using a thread for each line train and each passenger,
2. I am adding ReentrantLock lock for each station to aviod data race,
    as, at most one train can be at one station. Saved in a private field
    of MBTA class. Thus MBTA methods are signed with synchronized.
3. When trying to move to the next station, a train is locked firstly, and wait
    if there is already another train at the next station. After the next
    station is available, the train move to it and write the movement into log.
    Then the lock is released and let the train stay at the new station for 10ms.
    Since there is no bounded limit for passenger, passengers only need to wait
    if no target train or deboarding destination station is available.
