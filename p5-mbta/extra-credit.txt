I asked AI to create a graphical front-end that animates MBTA simulation logs. 
The visualizer displays:
- All train lines with their stations in a color-coded layout
- Real-time positions of trains on each line
- Passengers waiting at stations or riding on trains
- Step-by-step playback of simulation events
- Playback controls (play, pause, step, reset, speed adjustment)

FEATURES:
---------
1. Load any simulation configuration (JSON)
2. Load any simulation log file (log.json)
3. Visual representation with color-coded train lines:
   - Red Line: #DA291C
   - Orange Line: #ED8B00
   - Green Line: #00843D
   - Blue Line: #003DA5
4. Animated playback with adjustable speed (100ms - 2000ms per step)
5. Manual step-through for detailed inspection
6. Real-time event display showing current action
7. Progress indicator showing current step / total steps
8. The playback controls:
   - Play/Pause: Auto-play through the simulation
   - Step Forward/Backward: Manual control
   - Reset: Return to initial state
   - Speed slider: Adjust playback speed

Run the extension above by the following commands on bash:
./build
./sim sample.json(replace by your config file)
./build-visualizer 
./visualize
Then choose sample.json (load Config) and log.json (load Log) 
from your local disk and click play.
