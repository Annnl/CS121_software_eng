I used AI to build an extension of Simulation front-end by Java Swing Visualizer.
It successfully build the code part. However, it do not understand my jar files
and environment from the previous simulation system. 
It spends some time to rewrite sh file to build compiled code and run the visualizer.
In the first try, it does not include passengers' position on the board.
